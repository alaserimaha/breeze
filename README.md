Welcome to the GitHub repository of **Breez**, crafted by the **Fresh Sight** team for the **HPC** hackathon. **Breez** is a system capable of being linked to any camera. This system detects litter or trash discarded from vehicles onto the street, documents it as an infraction, and alerts the driver. Additionally, relevant authorities can access this data and generate reports on the level of waste on Saudi streets.


## Description

During our time with **HPC** hackathon, we worked on Breeze, a system capable of being linked to any camera. This system detects litter or trash discarded from vehicles onto the street, documents it as an infraction, and alerts the driver. Additionally, relevant authorities can access this data and generate reports on the level of waste on Saudi streets, all through "breeze".!

## Features


- **For Drivers**: Allows them to view details of their infraction.
- **For Authorities**: Provides access to data and assesses street pollution.
- **Integration**: Offers video explanations and illustrative diagrams for complex topics, particularly useful in subjects like medicine and engineering.
- **Integration**: Breez Can be connected with Saudi system "Saher".
- **AI Technologies**: we Used AI to deliver advanced solutions for a problem where it is lacking .


## Installation

Breez consists of two main components: the app (built with Laravel) and the API (powered by Django). Below are the steps to set up the API.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The project uses various Python packages, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
 pip install -r requirements. txt
```

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alaserimaha/breeze.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the API directory:
    ```bash
    cd breeze/django
    ```
3. Set up the Django environment:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints from your Laravel application to interact with the data processed by the Django backend.

## Language Statistics

To display language statistics as seen in many repositories (showing percentages of different programming languages used), you can utilize a GitHub Action or third-party service like Linguist which GitHub uses to perform language detection.

However, for a visual representation such as badges or charts directly in your README, services like Shields.io or GoReportCard can generate badges. GitHub does not automatically generate visual language statistics for display within the README other than through the repository insights.
